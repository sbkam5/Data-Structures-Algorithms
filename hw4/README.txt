This is my minimum distance program.

MAKING:
To Make the executable programs, type the commands "make distance0", "make distance", "make distance2", and "make distance3".

RUNNING:
To run the programs, type "./distance0", "./distance", "./distance2", or "./distance3".  To run all three at the same time, type "./runner".

INPUTS:
The inputs of the "distance", "distance2", and "distance3" executables are "input1.txt", "input2.txt", and "input3.txt" respectively.
The inputs of "distance0" are the "electrical engineering" and "computer science" strings.

OUTPUTS:
"distance0" will output 5 things:
1. The string to transform (String 1).
2. The string that String 1 will transform into(String 2).
3. The total cost of the cheapest combination of transformations, or the value of the edit distance operation.
4. String 1 after executing all of the transformations of the edit distance operation.
5. An output file called "Output.txt" that shows the transformations step by step.

The other three executables will only output the result of the edit distance operation.

Note: There is an output file called "instructions.txt".  The executables write to here every time they run.
It contains all of the transformations required for the edit distance operation.
