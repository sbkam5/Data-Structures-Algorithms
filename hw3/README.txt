To run all of the executables, you simply have to enter the command "./runner".


If you want to run them individually, here are the commands:


1. "./hashtable x" executes the program associated with the hashtable.  "x" is a number you specify which
determines the size of the hashtable that will be made.
"make hashtable" will make the executable if you dont already have it.

2. "./mst" executes the program associated with the minimum spanning tree functions.
"sparse_100000.txt" contains the input graph while "Output.txt" contains the output graph.
"make mst" will make the executable if you don't already have it.

3. "./mst2" executes the program assoctated with minimum spanning tree functions again.
This time, the input graph is dense.
"dense_100000.txt" contains the input graph while "Output2.txt" contains the output graph.
"make mst2" will make the executable if you don't already have it.

4. "./extra_credit" executes the program associated with the extra credit.
"make extra_credit" will make the executable if you don't already have it.
